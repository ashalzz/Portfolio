<p align="right">Today, Victoria, Lauren, and I used Arduino's Board of Education shield/bot to make two LED lights turn on using the bot's breadboard as shown by the pictures on the left. We used the example given and Neha's help to get one light to turn on, and then we copied what we did to get the one light on on the other side of the breadboard to turn the other light on.</p></br>

<p align="right">Today, Victoria, Lauren, Nia, and I created a light show using LED lights, Arduino, and the breadboard of the Arduino Board of Education shield/bot. After some trial and error, we were able to create a light pattern in the front row, which has the two red lights and the blue light alternating a show-and-hide type arrangement, whilst the back two white lights stay lit until the power is turned off as shown by the pictures on the left. Once we finished the first assignment, we wanted to extend the project by adding sound using Arduino and a piezo, and possibly coding for the robot to move using its servos. After a lot of tinkering, we were only able to make the piezo produce a single sound, although when the power was set to 2 rather than 1, it would alternate between two sounds. I wish we could have made it play a song or tune, but overall, I am happy with the outcome of this project. Click on the middle picture to see a screenshot of our code!</p></br>
